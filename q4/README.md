## Question 4 analysis

Question 4 was something that I prepared for before the exam. I knew the exam was always going to have something about 2D arrays, therefore I prepared myself for it. Part A was relatively very easy, however Part B was very tricky in my opinion, as not only does it require you to understand the concepts of a 2D array but also how to manipulate boolean expressions.

I think I did alright on this question However, I do fear that I might have incorrectly done the different boolean expressions. I can be entirely sure that I did something wrong, however, I do have an off-putting feeling when doing this assignment.
