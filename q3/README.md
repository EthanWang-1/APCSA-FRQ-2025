## Question 3 Analysis

Question 3 was definitely one of the more challenging questions for me on the exam, Particularly for Part B, as it requires me to really logically think about how the new array list is going to look. Part A, in my opinion, was sure explanation, and we are just using outside methods and information from the parameters to declare certain classes. 

While this question was challenging for me, I still believe I made the same response as I did on the test. Since I might have forgotten about my response, I used a similar method for the exam. However, I might have made some careless mistake due to the stress of the question.
