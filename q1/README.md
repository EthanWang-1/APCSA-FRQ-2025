## Question 1 Analysis

For this question, I skipped it at first, since I found the reading very challenging and proceeded to question 2 instead. However, I was still able to finish and return to this question after I finished question 2.

My first plan of action when approaching this prompt was to carefully read the following prompt and truly understand what the question wanted me to do. I believe that I did something very similar or not the same to the response I have currently to this question. I can really remember my response to this exam. However, I am positive I got the majority of the points for this question.
