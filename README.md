# APCSA-FRQ-2025
APCSA

## Introduction
This repository shows my response to the 2025 APCSA FRQ. It also includes my thoughts and reflections on my time taking the APCSA exam and being in this class. 

## Exam Reflection
The exam difficulty was mostly what I had expected. However, the MCQ was slightly harder than I had imagined, as the majority of it was regarding classes and inheritance, more than what I expected. The FRQ was fairly easy, however some of the reading from certain questions was longer and more complicated than what you imagine. The wording of the FRQ is the difficult part, in my opinion, but the code is rather simple and is what we practice in class. 

## FRQ 
The FRQ prep in class really helped with the exam. The amount of FRQ we completed and went over was very helpful for the AP Exam. 

The ability to grade our own FRQ was what really set this apart from regular FRQ practice. As of now, we are aware of the mistakes that we made and what is an acceptable response to the actual exam. These mistakes that we make ourselves leave a lasting impression on our minds' ton't do them again. This is very different when we get back our FRQ grade from you, as we focus more on the score rather than the mistake. Personally, for me, every time I see a mistake made by you, I usually lightly glance over it with the intention of doing better. However, I didn't truly cement the idea in my head. 

One thing that we could do differently will be use random partners to grade our work. I feel like when I grade my own work I do feel some way of basis towards it. By having someone else grade the work and having them call out what we did wrong, and having us defending our answer on why it is right, we are able to better understand our mistakes.

## MCQ 
The APCSA textbook was not helpful at all, the questions it asked were too hard for the exam and the explanation for the correct answer was too complicated. There were alot of errors in the textbook which led to more confusion than understanding. 

The MCQ on the college board was extremely helpful. The MCQ practices on each unit alongside the checks helped in the understanding of each question. When we get a question wrong on the college board, it gives us an explanation to guide us to the correct answer. I wish we did more college board prep than textbook prep, as the ability to check the answer and for the board to guide us to the right answer is better for understanding. The practices give a more realistic experience of the exam. 

The MCQ in the classroom that we do daily also helps a lot. However, I wish we tackled harder questions in class, and took the easier questions at home for practice.

## Growth Opportunities/Future Goals
Some units that I want to practice are classes and inheritance. While I was mostly confident when practicing and taking this exam, when I was doing the APCSA MCQ, it made me realize that I needed to practice on these subjects. 

While I am mostly confused about what major I want to pursue at college, I am considering taking some sort of technical or computer course. This class provides me with the opportunity to learn, in order to better enhance my coding skills. In this class, I want to create some sort of game using p5 and java in my own time. While I don't exactly have a perfect plan for this game of mine, I intend to seek more experience and inspiration from this project of mine.
