# APCSA-FRQ-2025
APCSA
## prep
The APCSA textbook was not helpful at all, the questions did it ask was too hard for the exam and the explanation for the correct answer is too complicated. There were alot of errors in the textbook which led to more confusion than understanding. //n
The MCQ on collegeboard was extremely helpful, the MCQ practices on each unit alongside the checks was helping in the understanding of each question. When we get a question wrong on collegeboard, it gives us a explanation to guide us to the correct answer. I wish we did more collegeboard prep than the textbook prep, as the ability to check the answer and for collegeboard to guide us to the right answer is better for understanding. The practices gives a more realistic experience of the exam. //n
The MCQ in the classroom that we did daily also helped alot, however I wish we tackled harder question in class, and do the easier question at home for practice.
