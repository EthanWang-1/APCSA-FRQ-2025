APCSA
## FRQ 
The FRQ prep in class really helped with the exam. The amount of FRQ we completed and went over was very helpful for the AP Exam. 

The ability to grade our own FRQ was what really set this apart from regular FRQ practice. As now we are aware of the mistakes that we commited and what is a acceptable response on the actual exam. These mistakes that we catch ourself, leave a lasting impression in our minds to not do it again. This is very different when we get back our FRQ graded from you, as we focuses more on the score rather than the mistake. Personally for me, every time I see a mistake graded by you, I usually lightly glance over it with the intention of doing better, however really I didnt cement the idea truly in my head. 

One thing that we could done differently, will be using random partners to grade our work. I feel like when I grade my own work I do feel some way of basis towards it. By having someone else grade the work and have them call out what we did wrong, and have us defending our answer on why it is right, we are able to better understand our mistakes.

## MCQ prep
The APCSA textbook was not helpful at all, the questions did it ask was too hard for the exam and the explanation for the correct answer is too complicated. There were alot of errors in the textbook which led to more confusion than understanding. 

The MCQ on collegeboard was extremely helpful, the MCQ practices on each unit alongside the checks was helping in the understanding of each question. When we get a question wrong on collegeboard, it gives us a explanation to guide us to the correct answer. I wish we did more collegeboard prep than the textbook prep, as the ability to check the answer and for collegeboard to guide us to the right answer is better for understanding. The practices gives a more realistic experience of the exam. 

The MCQ in the classroom that we did daily also helped alot, however I wish we tackled harder question in class, and do the easier question at home for practice.
