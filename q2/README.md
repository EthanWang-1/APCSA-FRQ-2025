## Question 2 Analysis

I found question two very easy to understand and write. Writing my own classes has always been easy for me. The prompt and mostly the examples on the test definitely boosted my understanding of what the question is asking. If I had to say, the only hard part about the code is deciding how many private instances variable are required, since it needs me to think as a whole, taking into account all the methods and information required to perform the task. 

They belief the code that I am writing currently is the exact same as what I submitted for the exam.
